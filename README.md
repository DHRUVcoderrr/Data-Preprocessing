# 🧹 Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is an essential step in any data science or machine learning project. This repository contains various techniques and scripts to clean, transform, and prepare raw data into a usable format for analysis and modeling.

---

## 📌 Features

* Handle **missing values** (removal, mean/median/mode imputation, forward/backward fill)
* **Outlier detection and treatment** using statistical and ML-based methods
* **Data scaling & normalization** (Min-Max, Standardization, Robust Scaling)
* **Categorical encoding** (One-Hot, Label Encoding, Target Encoding)
* **Feature engineering** (binning, log transformation, polynomial features)
* **Data splitting** into training, validation, and test sets
* **Pipeline creation** for reproducible workflows

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Programming Language:** Python 🐍
* **Libraries:**

  * `pandas` for data manipulation
  * `numpy` for numerical operations
  * `scikit-learn` for preprocessing utilities
  * `matplotlib` & `seaborn` for visualization

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-preprocessing.git
cd data-preprocessing
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run Notebooks or Scripts

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## 📊 Example Workflow

1. Import dataset
2. Handle missing values
3. Detect and treat outliers
4. Encode categorical variables
5. Scale and normalize numerical features
6. Split into train/test sets

---

## 📈 Visualizations

* Distribution plots before & after preprocessing
* Boxplots for outlier detection
* Correlation heatmaps for feature analysis
